I am an undegraduate researcher with the [Neuroethology](https://www.neuroethology.in/) and am being adviced by prof. [Bittu K Rajaraman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VIHjbnsAAAAJ&hl=en), at [Ashoka University](https://www.ashoka.edu.in/).  I completed my Bachelors of Science in Psychology with Honors from Ashoka and am currently enrolled in a year long post-graduate diploma in advanced studies and research, where I am working on a thesis. My thesis is in behavioural neuroscience where I will be studying the potential Metabolic Advantages of Depressive Behaviour in Zebrafish (Danio rerio). I also work in the Infant and Child Development Psychology Laboratory under Prof. [Madhavi Maganti](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=Ezw6fZMAAAAJ&hl=en).

I have always been interested in understanding human behaviour its relationship between mental health disorders. I am keen to continue research in this area and am actively looking for Masters and Doctoral opportuinities in the Fall of 2024. I welcome any suggestions/ interests in collaborations or to join the projects I am working on, obviously subject to my advisorâ€™s approval. You can find my email around here.
